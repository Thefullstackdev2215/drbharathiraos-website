                        <p>There are many high-risk babies who are born with disabilities or developmental delays and others whose limitations are identified later in the life. These children not only lack the basic skills of life, but also fail to attain the standard pace of physical and mental growth. They need special care, attention, and support to catch up with the required skills to maintain the basics of living. Early intervention programs are designed for such children but they are far too scattered and unorganized.
