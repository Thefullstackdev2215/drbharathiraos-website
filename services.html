                        The weak and fragile body of a patient needs extreme support after a surgery<br> while performing daily activities like going to washroom, taking bath, eating<br> and so on. Our stationed care takers extend the best support with full<br> compassion and dedication.

                                Disabilities and disorders of various kinds put a number of hurdles in the growth and living of people and their families. However, these disabilities must not limit the healthy sustenance and everyday existence of the suffering people. This is possible only by guiding, educating, and training the people with various physical and mental disabilities, impairments, or neurodevelopmental disorders. In India, we have special schools for the disabled or challenged, but most of them are fragmented and specific to certain health conditions.

                    Despite having age specific classification and schooling facility, we understand that children with special needs can have varying unique demands that cannot fit any specific category. That is why, we allocate the teaching curriculum, rehab program, and sessions based on the severity of their health condition and their IQ.

                    <br/>
                    The children who progress well are facilitated to join the mainstream education and appear for open 10th examinations. With proper guidance, support and academic facility, we make this happen.
